# jc3mp-linux-server-installscript
Script to install Justcause 3 Multiplayer on a Linux server

Make the install.sh executable as root by running " chmod +x install.sh "

Run install.sh as root and follow the prompts.

If you specify a username that doesn't exist, this will create a new user account to run the jc3 server - you will need to specify the username and password, be sure to remember them!

You will be asked to enter an alias, this is used to seperate if you have multiple servers, you can just use something simple e.g. "server1", "server2".. or "freeroam","race" etc.
If you only have one server you still need to enter something.
